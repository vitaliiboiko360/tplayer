Speaking along with an audio recording of native speaker.

It's not reciting after the native audio, it's literally talking over the top of the native audio (you can do it with a transcript or short clips you can easily memorise). Doing it over and over until you perfectly match - it's not a do it once and you're done, it's a do the same sentence 10-100x times until you match properly kind of thing. This way it forces you to match their timing, their rhythm, their emphasis etc. As OP says, you also force to match any word forms from conjugation or tenses etc perfectly so you cannot skip smaller details or it won't match.

You're not trying to learn vocab or any specific word for the audio, you should know basically all the words in something you're shadowing. The point is to get the timing and intonation to match the native speaker and focus on just that (no need to worry about generating correct sentence structure or picking right vocab, that's all done for you in the audio you're reciting).

Doing it at native speeds is deceptively hard to do well, and surprisingly helpful for solo speaking practise.
